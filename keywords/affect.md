## CURATORIAL STATEMENT 
Many scholars now use the word "affect" to describe feelings of attraction or revulsion rather than the word "emotion." After all, when we talk about the "mood" of the classroom or of the campus "climate," we recognize that affect may often seem to float free from the control of the supposedly autonomous liberal subject, far away from the manageable dictates of individual agency or grasp. 
 
KDH: Is there a way to excise the first person from this first paragraph and all other references in the curator’s statement? We’re refraining from it unless it relates to a specific teaching moment as evidence.
 
Among affect theorists, attention to the scene of learning is growing. For example, Lauren Berlant's *Cruel Optimism* observes that the substitute teacher is a key character of affective investment. In "Desiring Recognition, Accumulating Affect," educational researcher Megan Watkins observes that while "recognition" is often associated with "a positive process with the elicitation of positive affects," it "can also function in a negative way, carrying the resultant force of negative affects" (273). 
 
As instructors, how can we <—WHO’S THE WE HERE? meaningfully engage with exploring questions of affect? Such work is obviously important, because researchers who study embodied cognition see affect as central to how students perceive their educational experiences. Studies of the limbic system in the brain indicate that there may be complex and powerful interactions that could be better capitalized upon by instructors of literature and language to recognize how fight-or-flight responses, emotion, learning, and memory may be interrelated. Traditionalists in the profession who are wary of the scientism of neurobiology may be nonetheless mindful that considerations of "sensibility" have been extremely important in the English literary tradition. 
 
KDH: YEP — totally enjoy the way you separate these groups. Can you bring them back together? There will inevitably be some traditionalists exploring this collection. Do you think the above will alienate them?  
What would happen if we <—WHO IS THE “WE” HERE? invited students to use Facebook's recent expansion of the "like" button to include a range of emoticons to comment on their learning situation?  An instructor could hand out sticky notes to be affixed to objects in the classroom for this purpose or an assigned text could be annotated in the margin.
 
KDH: OH YES, CAN WE? DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BECOME TOO SARCASTIC AND CYNICAL, THOUGH?  
Exercises like these are simple to implement, but pedagogical labor around affect entails risk, particularly when feelings about feelings on campus are running high. Videos on YouTube tagged with affective terms like "angry student" or "angry professor" may receive hundreds of thousands of views. There are robust discussions about providing "trigger warnings" for content that might unleash uncontrollable grief within vulnerable students. Stock photos of college enrollees intended for brochures and websites inevitably show smiling faces as the ideal. We <—WHO IS THE “WE” HERE? talk about the "flat affect" of students who seem unable or unwilling to engage. Of course, these students may be like Mike Rose's classroom stoics who "just wanna be average" to avoid unwanted attention and are laying emotionally low for the class hour because they have trained themselves not to feel invested. 
 
KDH: The above examples are all true and intriguing, but how do they hang together? The paragraph moves quickly from trigger warnings to ads to Mike Rose
 
Affect is an important keyword both for computation and for teaching. <—WHY? Rosalind Picard is often credited with launching the field of affective computing at MIT, although Don Norman's work on emotional design is also seen as a seminal precursor. <—CAN YOU GIVE MORE HERE; LOTS WILL BE COMING TO THIS WITHOUT ANY EXPERIENCE OF THE SCHOLARSHIP
 
Digital pedagogy must answer the call of affect, because technophilia and technophobia frequently have strong affective components. Technology is supposed to have a rationalizing influence by offering learner analytics and classroom management, but detached logic doesn't describe how people respond to the presence of technology as an actor. "Flipped classroom hate tweets" and videos in which professors destroy the laptops and mobile phones of their students -- when used improperly in class -- show resentments can run high. As practictioners of the learning arts know, experiments with instructional technology may be either loved or hated with a passion. <—THIS PARAGRAPH DEMONSTRATES THE LATEST DEBATES ABOUT LAPTOPS IN THE CLASSROOM. CAN YOU PROVIDE AN ARTICLE/VIDEO/LINK OR TWO HERE AND THEN REBUT IT? 
 
Teaching writing may require particularly intense attention to the affects of our students. As Daniel Gross and Jonathan Alexander argue, "frameworks for success" often ignore the importance of negative emotions, as in the case of Anne Lamott's "shitty first drafts" described in her memoir about writing Bird by Bird. <—SAY MORE? MORE CONTEXT? WHY DOES THIS PARAGRAPH GO INTO TEACHING OF WRITING IN TERMS OF AFFECT? IS THIS THE HIGHLIGHT OF YOUR STATEMENT OR IS THERE MORE?
 KDH: IS THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH TURNING TOWARDS EXPLAINING THE ARTIFACTS?
This is part of the reason that instructors of digital writing have a prominent position in this curated collection of digital objects about affect. <—ALRIGHT, I SEE WHY YOU’RE INCLUDING THIS DISCIPLINE; THIS EXPLAINS THE ARTIFACTS
Teachers of multimodal composition may be more likely to incorporate new media platforms that solicit less filtered rapid responses -- including Snapchat, Yik Yak, and Vine -- and they may assign genres in which students attend to the nuances of facial performance and microexpressions, such as selfies. Aimee Morrison argues that selfies can capture "the ineffable"; her examples of online photography provide an overview of common mobile practices and genres. She notes that Snapchat illustrates how fleeting affect offers many possible moods, while a more composed Facebook profile pictures presents more affective stability. 
 
As teachers, we <—REMOVE THE “WE”? offend and comfort, solicit shame and pride about student performance, worry that we will be liked or disliked, and manage hilarity and solemnity in the rhythms of interaction. But we tell students to maintain neutral dispositions as scholars and writers, much as Wikipedia demands a neutral point of view from participating editors of content. This collection offers another way to speak about the passions of reading, research, and reflection to situate the call for objectivity that we often require of students producing academic discourse.  <—OK, I CAN SEE THE “WE” NEED HERE, BUT IS IT REALLY?

The Selfie Course is an open access curriculum designed by a world-wide collective of a dozen scholars of Internet research. The first unit, which was created by Terri Senft (http://www.terrisenft.net/wordpress/) and Gaby David, focuses on the topic of identity and interpellation and has a particularly useful ice-breaker exercise about creating self-portraits for particular audiences (dating website, corporate website, etc.) under the "Image Production Assignment" heading, which can personalize large lecture courses and make it easier to learn student names. This unit also has a number of examples of selfie campaigns for discussion that are directly relevant to the topic of affect, such as the "Woman Laughing Selfie" meme. <—HOW IS IT RELEVANT TO AFFECT? BE SPECIFIC; MAKE REFERENCE TO THE DEFINITIONS LAID OUT IN YOUR STATEMENT

Snapchat is a mobile application that is currently used by young people <—STUDENTS? OR HOW YOUNG? for irreverent documentation of their daily lives, because the photos and videos quickly disappear. <—DOES THIS CLAUSE DEFINE THE “IRREVERENT” STATUS? IT SEEMS TO BE HANGING OUT AT THE END OF THE SENTENCE, BUT IS IMPORTANT Given its ephemerality, it may seem a strange platform for research projects, but many Snapchat pedagogues find the spontaneity liberating and a good way for students to temporarily archive and comment on the mundane. Jill Walker Rettberg has created a series of "Snapchat Research Stories" that can serve as models for how to present research using informal discourse. <—SO INTERESTING; BUT HOW DOES IT RELATE TO AFFECT? 
Unlike other fast-format assignments, like the Ignite-style speech, preparation can be minimal and even done as an in-class exercise. In the sample videos Rettberg jogs, walks, drinks coffee, and chats with friends while discussing theoretical concepts. Instructors can ask students to deconstruct Rettberg's various moods in the videos as well.

Mark Marino is another prominent selfie pedagogue who has developed an assignment that asks students to open up an abstract concept, such as "double consciousness" or "symbolic ethnicity" by unpacking videos. He deploys the popular and banal genre of the unboxing video in which people open packages and react to the acquisition of new consumer items. In his sample Vine video Marino reacts to the arrival of "white privilege" on his doorstep. Marino provides a synopsis of the wordless plot: "It shows up at my door even though I didn't order (or pay for) it. When I open the box, I can't see it but put it on anyway, but when someone tries to take it, I get angry." <—HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO AFFECT THAT YOU’VE DEFINED IN THE STATEMENT?
 
## English Downfall

Hyperbolic emotions can also be rich material for the classroom, particularly as a way to discuss strong reactions to ideas or concepts. <—GREAT SYNOPSIS ABOUT WHY THIS ASSIGNMENT IS IMPORTANT 
“The Downfall Meme" was a popular genre of remix videos that used source material from a biopic of Hitler that showed the dictator breaking down in his bunker as he feels abandoned by military leaders. Although the topic of the film is serious, the meltdown into rage is so dramatic that without context this German-language scene is difficult to take seriously. Downfall meme videos cover a wide variety of subjects, ranging from Hitler responding to the subprime mortgage crisis to Hitler criticizing xBox Live. This version of the Downfall meme depicts Hitler defending traditional English departments and was published in the peer-reviewed online journal *Kairos*. <—HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO AFFECT?

Separating out the senses can be one way to emphasize differences of affect to enrich classroom discussion. <—GOOD; MORE LIKE THIS IN THE OTHER ENTRIES, TOO
This creative workshop from #PHONAR, a free and open undergraduate course designed by Jonathan Worth, asks students to create both a "landscape story" and a "soundscape story."  By generating two different kinds of narratives, students are asked how different sensory information might produce different affects. <—YES! VERY CLEAR ABOUT RELATIONSHIP TO AFFECT
 
## "The Mixtape Project" Assignment: Learning through Critical Making

Music can be a good way to present the modulation of affect to students and even to create a special temporal occasion in the classroom. <—YEP, GREAT!
For example, playing music appropriate to the theme of a lecture can be a good way to set the mood in the room. Or it can be useful to ask students to create playlists as a way to summarize course materials. This explanation of a mixtape assignment from Occidental's Center for Digital Arts asks students to "define a theme" that is "related to genre, canon, place, time period, and/or the social contexts (race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality) in which musical events take place."  Students must produce carefully crafted "liner notes" in lieu of a research paper in a rigorously scaffolded project that includes an abstract and an oral presentation. 
 
## GIF Assignment for DS 106

* Copy of Artifact:
* Creators: 
Like mixtapes or remix videos, gifs are a popular format for disseminating particular stances or attitudes around affect, although the format depends on looping rather than sequencing (or repetition rather than rhythm). Often gifs are used for focusing on making faces and may feature eye-rolling, double takes, and other emotional reactions. This exercise from the popular xMOOC Digital Storytelling 106 asks students to remix an animated course number with a gif, which can be a good way for students to identify what they see as salient about a course and how others might react to it. (DS 106 was part of the Connected Courses initiative, which is another useful place to think about digital pedagogy.)  
 
## Lemonade Syllabus

A syllabus is generally seen as a bureaucratic cut-and-dried legalistic document that is intended to establish course expectations. In contrast, music videos incorporate sound and imagery and use rhetorical power to tug at the audience's heartstrings. The Lemonade Syllabus combines material relevant to the album released by popular singer Beyonce with a demanding reading list on intersectional black feminism, next to which the student is encouraged to take notes. This syllabus is a particularly fitting choice for affect studies, given sections devoted to inspiration and religion and readings covering "pain," "joy," and "depression" in a section on "Historical & Cultural Studies."
 
## [CV of Failure

* Artifact Type:

* Copy of Artifact:
* Creators: 
This document created by a successful Princeton professor also mixes neutral and emotional genres. The topic of failure is often an important one in digital pedagogy, and more attention to failure or encouragement to explore failure has been advocated for by Mark Sample, David Parry, and others. Instead of asking students to complete a CV of failure, it may be more useful to assign a resume of failure, where you ask them to list all the things they applied for in areas normally allotted for "education," "work experience," and "activities."

Although challenging, editing Wikipedia can provide a very rewarding class assignment. This group of pedagogical online materials about editing Wikipedia as a class project includes sample assignments, instructional videos, and many other resources. The challenge to students accustomed to the genre of the five-paragraph theme is to adapt to Wikipedia's policies about avoiding individual research or expressing a point of view. As students work on their Wikipedia editing projects, you can direct discussion about the value presenting Wikipedia as an affect-free space and point to where "Talk" pages allow for more uninhibited venting.  
 
KDH: This is a great repository of assignments. But, to avoid overwhelming anyone who’s interested, can you use a particular assignment and reference the entire repository in the description? That will help anyone who’s interested.
