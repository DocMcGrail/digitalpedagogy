## CURATORIAL STATEMENT 

Many institutional statements on disability fixate on numbers. Numbers can be particularly alarmist artifacts. They call upon imagery of burden, worry, and distant hopes of rehabilitation. Numbers tell us that an increasing number of disabled students enroll in college every year. Numbers also tell us that disabled students face higher attrition rates than their nondisabled peers, and, even among those who graduate, disabled students face fewer employment prospects (Belch; Getzel and Thoma).

Of course, as with any terministic screen, numbers hide things. Numbers do not reveal how many disabled faculty and staff work at colleges and universities, at least not reliably still (Kerschbaum and Price). Numbers also suggest that upward of 90% of Internet spaces remain inaccessible to users of adaptive technologies, and yet the very framing of certain technology as "adaptive" obscures the extent and reaches of accessibility as a rhetorical and socio-technological problem (Oswal and Hewett). Even more, numbers indicate the dearth of resources available to disabled people on college campuses, wherein student services, digital media centers, libraries, and counseling services struggle to meet student demand. Yet, these numbers are partial and often encourage still more labor from those who are already most over-extended.

If it weren't already clear, this curation holds some ambivalence toward numbers, central as they are to disability and curricula. This isn't to say that the numbers aren't true, or that the problems they intimate aren't real or widely felt. Rather, numbers often redirect our attention toward alarmist renditions of disability. To rely on numbers as an exigency suggests that disability is only important to consider when it impacts the nondisabled (i.e., disability could happen to any of us at any time). These are, of course, the struggles of many minoritarian discourses: How to make others *care*?

This particular curation examines disability's exigencies by means of topics that bristle against numbers, that locate their exigences not by means of disability's burden but disability's representation. Students who have taken disability studies courses frequently relate that it is hard to unsee disability, in the world writ large, after they've taken such a class. Attention to disability, whether in a class exercise or major assignment, has tremendous potential to reshape the ways in which students come to understand themselves and the world around them. In this regard, representation often holds a dual meaning in disability-oriented pedagogy. First, if we return to dreaded numbers, we might direct our thinking from "how many people have disabilities and how do we help them?" to "where are all the disabled people, the supposed one-sixth of the population"? With the latter question, there's a move from *assisting* and *curing* toward civil rights and agency. We can ask this question in terms of self-representation, or how many disabled people are in a given room. We can also ask this question in terms of other-representation, or how non-disabled people effect representations of disability.

These questions concerning representation have significantly evolved over the past twenty years. In 1998, Simi Linton famously claimed that humanistic fields were perhaps the most hospitable spaces for disability studies. Her argument, in effect, concerned the ways in which allied health fields -- in particular, medicine, psychology, and special education -- conceived disability purely as a phenomenon in need of fixing, as numbers that should inspire fear in us all. Over the past decade, disability studies has expanded beyond Linton's earlier framework. As Elizabeth Brewer and Brenda Brueggemann note in their survey of articles published in [*Disability Studies Quarterly*](http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/4258/3598) between 2000-2012, the field has grown considerably more interdisciplinary, and considerably more mediated.

The mediation of disability studies has largely to with conflicting affordances and drawbacks  of digital spaces for disability activism. But it also has to do with other questions about representation, not only about nondisabled people and ideologies of ability, but the ways in which disability studies and activism has represented itself. As many of the artifacts below contend, disability studies has been a concertedly white and classed project. As a white disabled academic, I write this sentence with no small irony. Disabled people of color are routinely erased from the narratives we tell about the field and its histories. As well, academic spaces are spaces of distinct class and educational privilege. As teachers, we need to consider the ways in which our classrooms recreate the dynamics that disability studies has long sought to dismantle: that of the distal researcher studying disabled subjects, without their consent in the subjects that concern them most.

In laying out the above, my hope is that those who are new to disability studies will not come to these artifacts with yet more trepidation. Rather, I hope that these dynamics, many of them painful, might inspire questions, hopes, ideas, and, as Jay Dolmage says, "[places to start](http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/4632/3946)." Whose voices are we amplifying in the texts that we assign or analyze?

## CURATED ARTIFACTS 

### Developing and Reflecting on a Black Disability Studies Pedagogy

* Screenshot: blackds.png 
* Artifact type: Article 
* Source URL: [http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/4637/3933](http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/4637/3933)
* Creators: Jane Dunhamn, Jerome Harris, Shancia Jarrett, Leroy Moore, Akemi Nishida, Margaret Price, Britney Robinson, Sami Schalk

This article troubles disability studies and its elisions of Black
disability, as well as African American and African diaspora studies.
The article explores the contours of what Black Disability Studies (BDS)
might mean both as a curricular agent and a discipline unto itself,
while also resisting a definition or singular construction of BDS. The
authors pose a series of meditations on their experiences as faculty,
students, and activists in disability studies classes and the field writ
large. The article concludes with an outline of a course themed on Black
Disabled Experience, which includes learning objectives, core
competencies, and a list of course readings. The authors note that these
resources could be used in service of a stand-alone BDS course, but they
could also be used in service of radically reimagining other courses.

### Disability in KidLit

* Artifact type: Reviews 
* Source URL: [http://disabilityinkidlit.com/](http://disabilityinkidlit.com/)
* Creators: Corinne Duyvis, Kayla Whaley, Natasha Razi, Yahong Chi, and Kody Keplinger

*Disability in KidLit* is a multi-authored site that examines
representations of disability in young adult and children's literature.
Importantly, as the editors note, the articles in *Disability and KidLit*
privilege the perspectives of disabled people, and the call for
submissions emphasizes that only disabled people can submit
contributions to the site. The editorial call here diverges radically
from most scholarship on disability and literature, emphasizing, in
particular, that the site works to dispel the "problematic portrayals of
disability" that tend to permeate young adult literature and other media
representations. The website is vast, accessibly designed, and
meticulously organized. Users can search for content according to grade
level, genre, disability type, or assistive tool type. The website
serves as a welcome resource to instructors in K12 and in college, as
well as librarians.

### Disability Rhetoric

* Screenshot: disrhetoric.png 
* Artifact type: Teaching resource website
* Source URL: [http://disabilityrhetoric.com/](http://disabilityrhetoric.com/)
* Creators: Amy Vidali and Dev Bose, with Hilary Selznick, Tara Wood, and Dale Ireland

Created by Amy Vidali in 2009, *Disability Rhetoric* is a project of the
Disability Standing Group at the Conference of College Composition and
Communication (CCCC). Currently maintained by Dev Bose, *Disability
Rhetoric* hosts a number of resources related to teaching and research in
disability studies, including syllabi, bibliographies, job postings, and
calls for papers. While the website's exigence emerges from the field of
rhetoric and composition, the bibliographies and syllabi traverse
remarkable breadth, moving across topics and fields such as
phenomenology, queer studies, affect theory, design and digital studies,
and feminism. Relatedly, the standing group also runs a (co)mentoring
program for interested scholars at different stages in their careers,
and visitors to the website can find blog posts written by emerging DS
scholars on the DisRhet blog.

### Disability Studies, Temple U.

* Creators: Penny Richards, Mike Dorn, and Carol Marfisi

The Disability Studies at Temple blog might be better termed a blog hub
or blog conglomerate than a singular blog. For those wishing to delve
into the digital world of disability activism, blogging spaces represent
an important place to start, both historically and contemporarily.
Boasting over a decade of work, the DS at Temple blog curates and hosts
links to dozens of current and archived disability blogs, most of which
are locatable on the seemingly never-ending sidebar. These blogs range
considerably, both in terms of types of disability identities as well as
in bloggers' relationships to disability (e.g., disabled person, parent,
sibling, researcher). Of course, Disability Studies, Temple U. is a blog
in its own right, and its contributors regularly weigh in on disability
issues and participate in disability blog carnivals, such as the
long-running [Blogging Against Disablism Day](http://blobolobolob.blogspot.co.uk/p/blogging-against-disablism-day-2016.html).

### Judge Rotenberg Center Living Archive

* Creator: Lydia Brown

The Judge Rotenberg Center (JRC) is an institution that uses aversive
contingent electric shock on its disabled students, many of whom are
children. Located in Canton, MA, the JRC has been recipient of increased
scrutiny for its shock devices, which the Center forces students to wear
via backpack. As Lydia Brown notes, these devices are "intentionally
designed to be more powerful and painful than a police taser," and the
U.N. has declared JRC's practices as tantamount to torture. The JRC
Living Archive, created and maintained by Brown, is an expansive
repository that hosts a number of documents, including survivor
testimonies, trial coverage documents, media reports, governmental
memoranda, op-eds, and posters and ephemera from disability rights
protests, among other resources. While the reading is disturbing and
covers extremely violent content, the Archive can serve as a tremendous
resource for those who work or teach on activism and human rights
issues.

### Krip-Hop Nation

* Creator: Leroy Moore

Krip-Hop Nation, founded by Leroy Moore in 2007, actively promotes the
work and representation of disabled Hip-Hop artists. In particular,
Krip-Hop Nation works to educate teachers and those in the media
industry about disabled artists and disability music history (from the
distant past to the immediate present), with a concerted focus on what
Moore has termed AfroKrip performance. The Krip-Hop website is home to a
prolific blog, in which Moore conducts interviews and writes on topics
spanning African American Studies, poetry, police brutality, Black
Disability Studies, and lyric analysis. The site likewise hosts videos
of Krip-Hop performances, lectures, and campaigns that showcase a number
of disabled artists. With its highly mediated web presence, Krip-Hop
Nation provides extensive resources for those learning or teaching about
disability, race, representation, performance, and/or poetry.

### Modes of Embodiment: MULTI MODE ACCESS

* Artifact type: Student-run conference website
* Source URL: [https://multimodeaccess.wordpress.com/](https://multimodeaccess.wordpress.com/)
* Creators: Aimi Hamraie and Informational Access Design Team at Vanderbilt University

A collaboration between Hamraie and their students, this website is a
collaboratively organized conference developed as part of Hamraie's 2015
[Bionic Bodies, Cyborg Cultures](https://aimihamraie.wordpress.com/teaching/) course. Organized across modes, the
website provides material access through text, audio recordings,
PowerPoint slides, and an active tweetstream. The conference site
provides not only an example of an accessible website, but it likewise
models robust collaborative pedagogy. Hamraie notes that Master's
students organize and moderate the panels, taking communal
responsibility for advertising and running the conference. As well, the
conference routinely extends beyond the contours of the class. Community
members attend sessions, and people external to Vanderbilt participate
in the conversation via Twitter.

### NeuroQueer

* Artifact type: Blog 
* Source URL: [http://neuroqueer.blogspot.com/](http://neuroqueer.blogspot.com/)
* Creators: Elizabeth J. (Ibby) Grace, Dani Ryskamp, Michael Monje Jr., and Nick Walker

*NeuroQueer* (NQ) is a multi-authored blog that publishes cross-genre work
that spans disability and queer studies. A mashup of the words
*neurologically queer*, the term neuroqueer signals an emerging movement
that seeks to build coalitions among people who may variously identify
as mad, neurodivergent, disabled, and/or queer. The NQ blog, in
particular, prizes and embodies hybridity, seeking to reach activist and
academic audiences alike. Contributors include emerging activist voices
as well as established authors (novelists, poets, dramaturgs, and
scholars), each seeking to push the bounds of disability culture and
activism. Given the complexity and discursive breadth (queering?) of the
blog, instructors might find the [introductory posts](http://neuroqueer.blogspot.com/2015/05/neuroqueer-introduction-by-nick-walker.html), linked from the
sidebar, to be particularly generative starting points for class
discussions.

### SQUARE 8: Squawk About Disability and Society

* Artifact type: Blog

* Creator: Bev Harp

Even though it hasn't been updated since 2015, *SQUARE 8* represents among
the most mediated and resourced examples of disability activism blogs.
Run by Bev Harp, *SQUARE 8* has led a number of internet campaigns over
the past decade, ranging from 2015's [Autism Acceptance Challenge](http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/search/label/Autism%20Acceptance%20Challenge) to
2010's [Late Intervention Campaign](http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2010/02/late-interventions-contributions-from.html), the latter of which wryly targeted
the curative and often child-centric focus of autism research. Readers
of *SQUARE 8* may find its video posts useful in a variety of contexts,
including conversations related to disability, gender, and
professionalization more generally. Many of Harp's videos, such as
"[Perseveration in the Workplace](http://aspergersquare8.blogspot.com/2010/02/perseveration-in-workplace.html)," deconstruct ableist and sexist notions
of what it means to be collegial, punctual, interested, and
professional.

### "Why I Mind"

1. Video with subtitles: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoNR6EWT7D4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoNR6EWT7D4)
2. Video without subtitles: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ak5HHcrnI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4ak5HHcrnI)
* Creator: Brenda Brueggemann

In this six-minute video, Brueggemann stories through the common refrain
that deaf people face when asking others to repeat words and
conversations: "never mind." Using a combination of audio narration,
subtitles, visuals, and ASL, Brueggemann leads viewers through the story
of Carl Dupree, a Gallaudet student who was killed by police while
trying to sign. The screenshot featured here depicts Brueggemann's
subtitled version of "Why I Mind," whereas the second linked URL directs
to the uncaptioned version. When leading workshops on captioning and
disability, Brueggemann typically asks viewers to watch both versions,
paying close attention to the rhetorical affordances of the captioned
video. As well, Brueggemann at times plays a third variant of the
videos, using YouTube's auto-caption feature on the uncaptioned video.
Auto-caption, on the whole, results in wildly inaccurate captions, but
also, as Brueggemann notes, can generate a kind of found disability
poetry.
