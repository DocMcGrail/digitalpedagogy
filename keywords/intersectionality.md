## CURATORIAL STATEMENT

In 1989, critical race scholar and legal theorist Kimberlé Crenshaw coined the term “intersectionality” to address connections between dimensions of oppression that shape lived experience. In her work with women living in domestic violence shelters in Los Angeles, Crenshaw observed that black women were disproportionately affected by the compounding effects of race, gender, and class. At the same time, contemporary discourse on feminism failed to account for the specific needs of women of color, while anti-racist movements have failed to attend to the needs of women (1243-4). Crenshaw’s influential formulation has been expanded over time to reflect a broader range of intersections of identity categories and axes of oppression that produce and preclude privilege, shaping lived experience around the world (Carbin and Edenheim; Purkayastha; Davis). 

Curatorial statements in this collection, keywords such as “Queer,” “Sexuality,” and “Gender” can only be understood in terms of their relationships to each other, as well as to other categories such as race and class. Therefore, intersectionality itself is an essential keyword because it provides language and a theoretical basis for conceptualizing the matrices that shape both 
lived experience and oppression—and for using this mode of thought to develop digital literacy and critical thinking skills with students. 

In the context of pedagogy, intersectionality asks students to think beyond narrow binaries that overdetermine contemporary discourse on identity and power. It offers them a framework through which they can deconstruct their own subject positions and better understand the privileges and politics that are shaping their lives. Because intersectionality moves beyond single-issue approaches to identity, it promotes development of allyship and counters the effects of public discourse that pits identity categories against each other. Blending intersectionality with digital pedagogy enables students to become critical users and makers of technology. Through intersectional digital pedagogy, students articulate their own identities and the role of technology and culture in constructing these identities. Additionally, they are better equipped to understand the development of technology in the contexts of culture, history, and literature. 

The artifacts collected here include student work, standalone assignments, assignment sequences, and course syllabi that position intersectionality at the heart of inquiry and embody intersectional digital pedagogy. They represent the materials that have influenced my “Race and Cyberspace” course, a first-year seminar that engages students with intersectional approaches to race, gender, class, and other axes of identity within cultures of technology. Attending to a vast range of institutional contexts, these artifacts take advantage of open source, out-of-the-box tools and cheaply available technologies that can be easily incorporated into classes at universities without access to high-powered computing resources, digital humanities centers, or substantial financial resources. They offer students the opportunity to explore a range of intersecting identities, while foregrounding methods that can be adapted for a variety of course topics. These artifacts combine theoretical analysis with hands-on, experiential learning, while demonstrating that digital pedagogy can be incorporated across multiple disciplines. While promoting digital literacies, they also foster collaboration. Moreover, they represent the broadest conception of digital methods, from digital cultural mapping, new media analysis, and data visualization to digital storytelling and digital archives to videogames and wearables. In doing so, the artifacts here demonstrate how an intersectional lens can facilitate a range of approaches to digital pedagogy that take into account the intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, nation, and other axes of oppression. 

## CURATED ARTIFACTS 

#### “Runaway Quilt Project: Digital Humanities Exploration of Quilting During the Era of Slavery”

* Creator: Deimosa Webber-Bey, Pratt Institute School of Library and Information Science  

Deimosa Webber-Bey’s article describes her process of creating *The Runaway Quilt Project* for an assignment in Chris Alen Sula’s [introductory digital humanities course](http://chrisalensula.org/digital-humanities-spring-2012/) at the Pratt Institute. As such, it provides an example of how students can draw on their personal experiences at the intersections of their own identities to develop a digital project in the context of a course. Drawing on her work as an African and African American Studies scholar and experienced quilter, Webber-Bey explored the claim that quilts served as signs along the Underground Railroad through many small-scale forms of digital data analysis: data visualizations in Tableau Public, digital annotations using Digress.it, word frequency analysis through Google N-grams Viewer, a timeline in TimelineJS, geospatial mapping using Leaflet Maps Marker, and network analysis in Cytoscape. Each method used in the project drew on material introduced in Sulu’s course. This collection of assignments serves as an exemplar for how students can undertake multiple, small-scale analyses to create a multi-pronged approach to a single research topic. Together, these modular approaches suggest how instructors can assist students in developing substantial projects on the complex intersections of race and gender by revisiting a data set through different research methods.

#### “Teaching Artifact - Assignment: Digital Ethnography”

* Copy of Artifact: [files/intersectionality-Digital-Ethnography.pdf](files/intersectionality-Digital-Ethnography.pdf)
* Creator: Lori Ostergaard, Oakland University

The digital ethnography assignment designed by Lori Ostergaard positions intersectionality at the heart of the rhetorical and ethical dimensions of the internet. Among the goals for Ostergaard’s course are “study and apply theories of digital culture and its effects on online communities, especially in relation to ethnicity, gender, class, physical ability, and sexual orientation.” After initial assignments examining students’ own online identities and researching emerging media forms, the digital ethnography assignment requires them to interact with and analyze online communities as participant-observers. In their guided analysis, students apply their understanding of intersectional theories of identity to their study of the online community. They also produce a multimodal final project on the community, composing either a hyperlinked website or article, wiki article, narrarated slideshow, or documentary video. This assignment encourages students to understand the relationship between online and offline identities by examining behaviors and language used in online communities. In their applied analysis, students explain knowledge of how the internet is grounded in intersecting axes of oppression. While this assignment is useful for ethnography, I have used it in my own classes for autoethnography - asking students to examine their own interactions with others online through platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Snapchat, and Yik Yak. This exercise enabled students to think critically about their own role as users and creators of online content. They further reflected on how the intersecting dimensions of their own identities shape their experiences online and their attitudes about life offline.

* Copy of Artifact: [files/intersectionality-Women-Writing-Worldwide.pdf](files/intersectionality-Women-Writing-Worldwide.pdf)
* Creator: Jenn Brandt, High Point University 

Through the assignment “Women Writing Worldwide,” Jenn Brandt’s students explore the affordances of digital cultural mapping for understanding the relationship between transnational feminist theory and global contemporary women’s fiction. She contends that mapping engages students from diverse backgrounds and connects them to the issues that affect women’s lives around the globe. Students begin by using the Tour Builder storytelling tool in Google Earth to map their own lives and tell their own stories. After connecting them to the platform through their own experiences, Brandt asks students to map the course material. In the collaborative project, each student is assigned a country and asked to research its context for women’s experiences. This assignment is significant for intersectional digital pedagogy because it challenges the students to think critically about the different experiences of oppression of women around the world and to understand the global as an assemblage of the local.

#### “Teaching with Tumblr: Building a Digital Archive of Gender, Race & Empire” ![screenshot](images/intersectionality-Teaching-with-Tumblr.png)

* Creator: Bianca Murillo, California State University, Dominguez Hills

Created by Bianca Murillo’s history students, [“Gender, Race & Empire”](http://gender-race-empire.tumblr.com) offers an example of engaging students with the microblogging platform Tumblr to build an intersectional digital archive. To contribute to the archive, as Murillo describes, students posted short, frequent reflections on course readings and discussions to explore the intersections of empire and sexuality through both historical and contemporary examples of racism. Using Tumblr not only facilitated frequent posting but also aggregated student work in an archive that allowed them to work collaboratively, building on each others’ posts throughout the course. These Tumblr assignments provided hands-on experience in the constructedness of archives and how both history and archives are shaped by the intersections of race, sexuality, and colonialism. Notably, Murillo addresses the challenge of assessment for this class assignment, as well as student responses, which indicated that the assignment offered them freedom to experiment. Instructors interested in creating collaborative class archives that allow students to explore the intersections of axes of identity such as race, gender, and sexuality can draw on Murillo’s concrete advice for a strict post schedule, guidelines, and use of hashtags to track discussion topics and connections between themes in the Tumblr archive over time. 

#### “U Stories: Latina Life Stories”

* Creator: Rina Benmayor, California State University, Monterey Bay

Rina Benmayor’s work with students on Latina Life Stories at California State, Monterey Bay, connects students with the intersections of race, ethnicity, class, immigration status, sexuality, and technology. After studying writing by Latinas of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Dominican, Cuban, Chicana, and mixed heritage, students produce digital stories exploring their own identities and experiences. In these stories, Benmayor’s students share personal and family histories on themes like bodies, migration, and violence. By encouraging students to produce digital stories, Benmayor helps them find their own voices as writers and to reflect on their own histories, situated at the intersections of their identities. Additionally, the assignment suggests how students can be critical makers of technology, blending recorded narrative with visuals to bring their personal stories to life. 

#### “Teaching Twentieth Century Art History with Gender and Data Visualizations”

* Creator: Nancy Ross, Dixie State University

In this article, Nancy Ross describes her approach to teaching gender and sexuality in 20th century art history with interactive data visualization. Ross speaks to the challenges of teaching about gender and sexuality at a conservative university in Utah, suggesting that engaging students with art through a new approach facilitates their understanding and experiences with the topics. Through similar assignments that include [teaching Renaissance art history with Pinterest,](Teaching Renaissance Art History with Pinterest) and [data visualization of exhibition catalogs,](Digital Art History for Beginners: The Spreadsheet), Ross’s students explore connections between women artists and their interlocutors, taking into account sexuality as well. biographical data or their assumptions that these artists were all heterosexual. Instructors can draw on assignments such as these to give students the opportunity to challenge their own biases, prejudices, and deeply held beliefs about the intersections of identity categories with cultural production, whether in art history or in other disciplines. 

#### Teaching Embodiment through Technology

* Creators: Leah Zani, University of California, Irvine and Marzieh Kaivanara, University of Bristol

Leah Zani and Marzieh Kaivanara’s modular assignment sequence asks students to think critically about the technologized body. Their goal for this sequence is to encourage students to understand their own bodies in relation to technology and power. They begin the assignment with theoretical discussions of race, gender, and other facets of identity. Students participate in activities intended to connect them with their own bodies and supplement their understanding of embodiment. Then, they introduce students to scholarship on technological embodiment. Finally, the class collectively analyzes images of technologized bodies sourced by students. Zani and Kaivanara then ask their students to consider their own use of bodily technologies, from glasses to cavities to wearable activity monitors. In doing so, they offer a model for teaching students to reflect on the relationship between gender, ability, and technology. 

#### “Video Games as Feminist Pedagogy”

* Creator: Samantha Allen, Independent Scholar

Samantha Allen makes the case that videogames are essential to teaching feminist pedagogy. She describes using videogames to teach units on transgender studies and intersectionality. These games, Allen argues, bridge gaps between students who do not share an understanding of feminism, leveraging their experiences with a shared understanding of videogames. She introduces her students to independent videogames, such as *dys4ia,* *Lim,* and *Mainichi,* made by people who are part of sexual and gender minorities  to introduce students to perspectives other than their own. Additionally, Allen guided them through play of the mass-market game, *Halo,* interspersing game play with discussion groups to facilitate critical thinking about the game and to model intersectional dimensions of oppression. These assignments take advantage of students’ immersion in technological cultures to introduce theories of intersectionality and challenge them to consider their own experiences in relation to those who may not share them.

#### “Panama Silver, Asian Gold: Migration, Money, and the Making of the Modern Caribbean & Panama Silver, Asian Gold: Reimagining Diasporas, Archives, and the Humanities”

* Creators: Leah Rosenberg, Donette Francis, and Rhonda Cobham-Sander, University of Florida

“Panama Silver, Asian Gold: Reimagining Diasporas, Archives, and the Humanities” is the latest iteration of a collaborative, cross-institutional course taught at Amherst College, University of Florida, University of Miami, and the University of the West Indies, Cavehill, Barbados. The first iteration was taught in 2013 at Amherst, University of Florida, and University of Miami. Students in the course undertake with archival research, digital scholarship, and literary studies of the Caribbean through an interdisciplinary lens. Through class assignments, they consider the colonial dimensions of archives, examining how particular facets of identity and subalternity influence Caribbean writers and scholars. The course demonstrates that intersectionality produces a range of interventions in the archive that students can make when using the Digital Library of the Caribbean. For example, Yilin Andre Wang’s [“Mapping LGBT Caribbean Literature.”](https://queercaribbeanlit.wordpress.com/) explores the queer Caribbean and its intersections of race, sexuality, gender, class, and nation through maps and timelines that illustrate the rise of LGBT representations in literature. This student project illuminates this important body of work that is often unrecognized in archives. 

#### “Fashioning Circuits”

* Creator: Kim A. Knight, University of Texas at Dallas

Kim Knight’s course materials for “Fashioning Circuits” bring together the history of fashion and wearable electronics to explore the effects of media on bodies at the intersections of race, gender,
class, ability, and sexuality. After small-scale projects to introduce students to creating wearables as well as class discussions about intersectionality and media culture, students produce social justice-oriented wearable projects intended to provide a solution to a problem, make a statement, or create a social intervention. This hands-on experience in critical making is accompanied by discussion of the affordances and limitations of fashion and its relationship with wearable electronics. While other course materials that blend new media with intersectionality tend to emphasize analysis and multimodal writing to assess student outcomes, “Fashioning Circuits” asks students to perform the critiques they are making by creating digital objects of a different kind - LED safety jackets for dogs, a carbon monoxide sensing hat, or an anti-anxiety bracelet - to demonstrate their understanding of intersectionality and technology.
